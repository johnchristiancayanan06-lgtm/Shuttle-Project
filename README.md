# Shuttle-System

1. **System Overview**
ShuttleOS provides real-time visibility into fleet logistics. Depending on your assigned role, you will have specific permissions to manage users, monitor shuttle movements, or analyze passenger data.


2. **Detailed Instructions by Role**

**Super Admin** The System Architect
As a Super Admin, you are responsible for the system's integrity and user management.

To Add an Account: Navigate to User Management > Add New. Fill in the credentials and select a role from the dropdown menu.

To Manage Roles: To upgrade or downgrade a user, click Edit on their profile and select the new Role Tier.

Security: Only you have the "Delete" button. Use this cautiously as it permanently removes user history.

**Admin** The Coordinator
The Admin role focuses on maintaining the accuracy of existing user data and overseeing daily operations.

Updating Profiles: You can update contact information or reset passwords for users if they get locked out.

Viewing Records: You have full access to the user directory to see who is currently active in the system.

Constraint: You do not have the authorization to change a user's role (e.g., promoting a Dispatcher to an Admin). This must be requested from a Super Admin.

**Dispatcher** The Monitor
The Dispatcher role is optimized for "read-only" high-speed monitoring.

Live Dashboard: This is your primary screen. It shows active shuttle locations and live passenger counts.

Historical Records: You can search through past logs to verify passenger totals for specific dates or routes.

Constraint: You cannot edit any user profiles or system settings. Your access is strictly for operational oversight.

3. **Key Features & Navigation**
The Monitoring Dashboard
The heart of the system. Here you can see the Daily Passenger Count and the Shuttle Status (Active, In Maintenance, or Idle).

Passenger Records
Located in the sidebar, this section allows you to generate reports based on specific timeframes. You can view:

Total boardings per day.

Peak transit hours.

Individual shuttle performance.
